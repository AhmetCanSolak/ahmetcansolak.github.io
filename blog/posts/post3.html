                                <p class="uk-text-lead"> Yesterday was the last day before new spring semester. After breakfast, I suddenly realized have some spare time after a long while.
                                                         My friends were still not arrived to campus, so I started to looking for a litte programming project to make my day more fun. Found a
                                                         calm place with a nice view and sit. Then, Pygame came to my mind and jumped into implementing a small simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with that.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                <img src="../images/post3-view.jpg" alt="" />

                                I had not used Pygame till yesterday but, thankfully, it is easy to learn and use. With the help of several Stack Overflow answers upon simple Google queries, I was
                                able to finish a simple 3x3 demo implementation in a couple of hours.

                                <br>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>1 - link</li>
                                  <li>1 - link</li>
                                  <li>1 - link</li>
                                  <li>1 - link</li>
                                </ul>

                                Overall, I enjoyed using Pygame much. Since implementing small simple games is a great way to practise programming, I am planning to have some other games and blog posts on them. <br>
                                Thank you. <br>
